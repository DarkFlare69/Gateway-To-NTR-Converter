# Gateway-To-NTR-Converter

This is a program I made that will automatically convert Gateshark codes to NTR. The converter itself was written completely from scratch with no code taken from Nanquitas' Gateshark2NTR or from any other converter. I wrote one in Python a while ago, but it wasn't very good due to my limited knowledge of that language. This one is a major improvement over it. However, I am still a beginner at programming, so the source code is very dirty. I could improve it a lot, although it isn't really necessary as the program functions optimally.

# Features
-Code Checker, to see if your codes will convert properly

-Help pages, such as the NDS Codetype documentation

-Optimization, to clean up the code once it's converted to NTR

-Plugin builder, build the plugin file with one click

-Copy to Clipboard, to easily copy all of the converted codes


# Advantages over other converters
