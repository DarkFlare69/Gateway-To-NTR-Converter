# Gateway To NTR Converter

This is a program I made that will automatically convert Gateshark codes to NTR. The converter itself was written completely from scratch with no code taken from Nanquitas' Gateshark2NTR or from any other converter. I wrote one in Python a while ago, but it wasn't very good due to my limited knowledge of that language. This one is a major improvement over it. However, I am still a beginner at programming, so the source code is very dirty. I could improve it a lot, although it isn't really necessary as the program functions optimally.

# Features
-Code Checker, to see if your codes will convert properly<br/>
-Help pages, such as the NDS Codetype documentation<br/>
-Optimization, to clean up the code once it's converted to NTR<br/>
-Plugin builder, build the plugin file with one click<br/>
-Copy to Clipboard, to easily copy all of the converted codes<br/>

# Advantages over other converters
-Online support for all plugins created using this converter<br/>
-Can convert codes into CTRPluginFramework<br/>
-Support for folders, notes, and other menu features<br/>
-Open Source<br/>
-The source code of your plugin will be openly available inside of the /pluginMenu directory<br/>
-Complete UI<br/>
-Type/copy codes as text or load them from a file<br/>
-All of the things listed above under "Features"<br/>
